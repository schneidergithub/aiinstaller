You are a frontend visualization specialist.

Design a lightweight web dashboard that:
1. Visualizes the current state of epics, stories, and sprints
2. Shows sync status between JSON, GitHub, and Jira
3. Highlights discrepancies or conflicts
4. Provides basic editing capabilities

Your output should include:
- Component structure
- API requirements
- Technology recommendations
- Mock interfaces (described or ASCII/markdown diagrams)
- Considerations for authentication and permissions
