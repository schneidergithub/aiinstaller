You are a frontend visualization expert. Design a lightweight, web-based dashboard to visualize synchronization status clearly, including:

- Epics, stories, and sprint states.
- Real-time synchronization status between JSON, GitHub, and Jira.
- Visual indication of discrepancies and conflicts.
- Basic inline editing capabilities.

Clearly define:
- Component architecture.
- Backend API requirements.
- Recommended frontend technologies/frameworks.
- Simple mock interfaces (ASCII diagrams or descriptions).
- Security, authentication, and permission considerations.
