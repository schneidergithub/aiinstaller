You are a synchronization system architect. Design a robust bidirectional synchronization system that:

- Detects changes directly in GitHub and Jira.
- Syncs changes with a JSON source of truth.
- Implements clear conflict resolution strategies (e.g., JSON priority, most recent update, manual selection).

Your design must include:
- A clear logic flowchart describing the synchronization flow.
- API endpoints for detecting and applying changes.
- Examples of each conflict resolution strategy.
- Recommended synchronization frequency and triggers.
- Error handling and recovery procedures.
