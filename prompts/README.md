They help AI tools analyze, generate, and improve the syncing between GitHub and Jira based on the PMaC-powered JSON source of truth.

## How to Use These Prompts

1. Select the appropriate prompt for your current task
2. Combine with the relevant JSON files from the `data/` directory
3. Submit to your preferred LLM
4. Review, refine, and implement the suggestions
