You are an expert toolbuilder.

Using the provided `data/project_plan.json` (merged or modular files), generate:
- The GitHub CLI or API commands needed to create each story, epic, sprint, and board view
- The Jira API payloads and endpoint calls for matching content in Jira

Base the outputs on:
- Best DevOps and Agile standards
- Using label-based story classification
- Linking stories to epics and sprints where defined

Avoid creating duplicate issues. Include checks to verify existence before creation.
